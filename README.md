The assets that were used by the team to build the game are not self-made assets. Rather, they were extracted from the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/. This website consists of game assets that can be used by game developers to accelerate the development process of their game. The assets below were extracted from the Unity Asset Store and they were used for particular functions in the game development process:
1. Cainos Assets:
- Pixel Art Platformer Village House: Used to add village houses to the game background and build an environment that suits the desired aesthetic of the game.

- Customisable Pixel Character: Used for adding the Player Character and the Non-Playable Characters in the game. This asset also contained extra functionality that made prefabbed characters, with complex animation rigs and player controller scripts that enabled the team to have an existing the player character without having to make the scripts and animations ourselves. We decided to keep these premade scripts and animation rigs into our player character because of its complex coding structure and advanced usage of Unity features.
